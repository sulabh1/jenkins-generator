# Docker Compose Guide 🐳

This guide explains how to use the automatically generated `docker-compose.yml` file for local development and infrastructure testing.

## Why Docker Compose?

When you configure external services (like databases, caches, or message queues) for your project, `jenkins-generator` creates a `docker-compose.yml` file in your project root. This allows you to:

1.  **Test Locally**: Spin up the exact same infrastructure your app needs on your local machine.
2.  **Validate Connections**: Ensure your app can connect to the services before deploying to Jenkins/Cloud.
3.  **Consistent Environments**: Every developer on your team can run the same setup with one command.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** (Mac/Windows) or **Docker Engine** (Linux)
- **Docker Compose** (V2 is recommended)

### Usage

To start all services defined in your configuration:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To stop and remove containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Generated Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` includes:

- **Your Application**: Built from your `Dockerfile`.
- **External Services**: Official images for databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.) with default credentials.
- **Network**: All services are on the same bridge network for easy communication.
- **Volumes**: Persistent storage for databases where applicable.

## Environment Variables

The generator also creates a `.env.template` file. To connect your app to the local Docker services:

1.  Copy `.env.template` to `.env`.
2.  The default values in `.env.template` are usually configured to match the `docker-compose.yml` defaults.

## Troubleshooting

### Port Conflicts

If you see an error like `Bind for 0.0.0.0:5432 failed: port is already allocated`, it means you have another service (like a local PostgreSQL) running on that port. Stop the local service or change the port in `docker-compose.yml`.

### Connection Refused

Ensure all containers are running using `docker-compose ps`. If a service crashed, check logs with `docker-compose logs <service-name>`.
